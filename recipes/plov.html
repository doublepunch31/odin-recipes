    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Plov is Central Asia's beloved national dish, a fragrant rice pilaf cooked in large cast-iron pots called kazans. The dish combines long-grain rice with lamb, carrots, onions, and garlic, seasoned with cumin and cooked in plenty of oil. The technique involves browning the meat and vegetables first, then layering rice on top to steam and absorb all the flavors. More than just food, plov is a symbol of hospitality and celebration, often prepared in huge quantities for weddings and community gatherings.</p>
